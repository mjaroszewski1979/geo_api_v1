## Project Requirements Document for Geo Api

### Unit Tests

#### General Requirements

Requirement | Condition | Expected Outcome | Test Case
----------- | --------- | ---------------- | ---------
User authentication and authorization must be implemented correctly for API endpoints. | When making requests to authenticated endpoints. | Users with valid authentication tokens should be able to access and perform CRUD operations on geolocation data. Unauthorized users should receive a 401 Unauthorized status code. | bearer_token
The API must handle errors gracefully. | When invalid requests are made (e.g., incorrect endpoints, missing parameters). | The response should include appropriate error messages and status codes (e.g., 404 Not Found, 400 Bad Request). | bearer_token

#### Geo API Endpoints Requirements

Requirement | Condition | Expected Outcome | Test Case
----------- | --------- | ---------------- | ---------
The geo-detail endpoint must retrieve geolocation details correctly. | When a GET request is made to the geo-detail endpoint with a valid IP address. | The response should have a status code of 200. The response data must include the IP address that was queried. | test_get_geo_detail
The geo-delete endpoint must delete geolocation data correctly. | When a GET request is made to the geo-delete endpoint with a valid IP address. | The response should have a status code of 200. The response data should indicate successful deletion with the message {'Success': 'Geolocation successfully deleted!'}. | test_delete_geo
The geo-create endpoint must create new geolocation data correctly. | When a POST request is made to the geo-create endpoint with valid data. | The response should have a status code of 200. The response data must include a message confirming the addition of the geolocation with 'Geolocation added!'. | test_create_geo

#### Create User View Requirements

Requirement | Condition | Expected Outcome | Test Case
----------- | --------- | ---------------- | ---------
The create user view must handle GET requests correctly. | When a GET request is made to the 'create-user' URL. | The response should have a status code of 200. The response must use the 'index.html' template and contain a form of type UserCreationForm. | test_create_user_get
The create user view must handle POST requests correctly. | When a POST request is made to the 'create-user' URL with valid user creation data. | The response should have a status code of 401 (Unauthorized), indicating authentication is required for user creation. The number of users in the database should remain unchanged after the request. | test_create_user_post

#### Geo Detail View Requirements

Requirement | Condition | Expected Outcome | Test Case
----------- | --------- | ---------------- | ---------
The geo-detail view must handle GET requests correctly. | When a GET request is made to the 'geo-detail' URL with a valid IP address. | The response should have a status code of 401 (Unauthorized), indicating authentication is required to access geolocation details. | test_geo_detail_get_without_authentication

#### Geo Create View Requirements

Requirement | Condition | Expected Outcome | Test Case
----------- | --------- | ---------------- | ---------
The geo-create view must handle GET requests correctly. | When a GET request is made to the 'geo-create' URL. | The response should have a status code of 401 (Unauthorized), indicating authentication is required to access the geolocation creation form. | test_geo_create_get_without_authentication

#### Geo Delete View Requirements

Requirement | Condition | Expected Outcome | Test Case
----------- | --------- | ---------------- | ---------
The geo-delete view must handle GET requests correctly. | When a GET request is made to the 'geo-delete' URL with a valid IP address. | The response should have a status code of 401 (Unauthorized), indicating authentication is required to delete geolocation data. | test_geo_delete_get_without_authentication

#### Geolocation Model Requirements

Requirement | Condition | Expected Outcome | Test Case
----------- | --------- | ---------------- | ---------
The Geolocation model must function correctly. | When creating a new Geolocation object with specified attributes. | The Geolocation object should be saved successfully, and the total count of Geolocation objects in the database should be 1. The IP address of the saved Geolocation object should match its string representation. | test_geolocation_model

#### API Token View Requirements

Requirement | Condition | Expected Outcome | Test Case
----------- | --------- | ---------------- | ---------
The api-token view must handle POST requests correctly. | When a POST request is made to the 'api-token' URL with valid authentication credentials. | The response should have a status code of 200, indicating successful token generation. | test_api_token_post

#### API Token Refresh View Requirements

Requirement | Condition | Expected Outcome | Test Case
----------- | --------- | ---------------- | ---------
The api-token-refresh view must resolve correctly. | When resolving the 'api-token-refresh' URL. | The view function should correctly resolve to the TokenRefreshView class. | test_api_token_refresh_url_is_resolved

#### Geolocation API Integration Requirements

Requirement | Condition | Expected Outcome | Test Case
----------- | --------- | ---------------- | ---------
The get_geo function must correctly retrieve geolocation data for a valid IP address. | When get_geo is called with a valid IP address and a valid API key. | The function should return a dictionary indicating success with a message {'Success': 'Geolocation added!'}. | test_get_geo_valid_ip
The get_geo function must handle invalid IP addresses correctly. | When get_geo is called with an invalid IP address (e.g., '12') and a valid API key. | The function should return a dictionary indicating failure with an error message: | test_get_geo_invalid_ip
The get_geo function must handle invalid API keys correctly. | When get_geo is called with a valid IP address and an invalid API key. | The function should return a dictionary indicating failure with an error message: | test_get_geo_invalid_api_key
