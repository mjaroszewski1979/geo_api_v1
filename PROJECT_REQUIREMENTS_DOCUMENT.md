## Project Requirements Document for Geo Api

### Unit Tests

#### General Requirements

Requirement | Condition | Expected Outcome | Test Case
----------- | --------- | ---------------- | ---------
User authentication and authorization must be implemented correctly for API endpoints. | When making requests to authenticated endpoints. | Users with valid authentication tokens should be able to access and perform CRUD operations on geolocation data. Unauthorized users should receive a 401 Unauthorized status code. | bearer_token
The API must handle errors gracefully. | When invalid requests are made (e.g., incorrect endpoints, missing parameters). | The response should include appropriate error messages and status codes (e.g., 404 Not Found, 400 Bad Request). | bearer_token

#### Geo API Endpoints Requirements

Requirement | Condition | Expected Outcome | Test Case
----------- | --------- | ---------------- | ---------
The geo-detail endpoint must retrieve geolocation details correctly. | When a GET request is made to the geo-detail endpoint with a valid IP address. | The response should have a status code of 200. The response data must include the IP address that was queried. | test_get_geo_detail
The geo-delete endpoint must delete geolocation data correctly. | When a GET request is made to the geo-delete endpoint with a valid IP address. | The response should have a status code of 200. The response data should indicate successful deletion with the message {'Success': 'Geolocation successfully deleted!'}. | test_delete_geo
The geo-create endpoint must create new geolocation data correctly. | When a POST request is made to the geo-create endpoint with valid data. | The response should have a status code of 200. The response data must include a message confirming the addition of the geolocation with 'Geolocation added!'. | test_create_geo

#### Create User View Requirements

Requirement | Condition | Expected Outcome | Test Case
----------- | --------- | ---------------- | ---------
The create user view must handle GET requests correctly. | When a GET request is made to the 'create-user' URL. | The response should have a status code of 200. The response must use the 'index.html' template and contain a form of type UserCreationForm. | test_create_user_get
The create user view must handle POST requests correctly. | When a POST request is made to the 'create-user' URL with valid user creation data. | The response should have a status code of 401 (Unauthorized), indicating authentication is required for user creation. The number of users in the database should remain unchanged after the request. | test_create_user_post

#### Geo Detail View Requirements

Requirement | Condition | Expected Outcome | Test Case
----------- | --------- | ---------------- | ---------
The geo-detail view must handle GET requests correctly. | When a GET request is made to the 'geo-detail' URL with a valid IP address. | The response should have a status code of 401 (Unauthorized), indicating authentication is required to access geolocation details. | test_geo_detail_get_without_authentication

#### Geo Create View Requirements

Requirement | Condition | Expected Outcome | Test Case
----------- | --------- | ---------------- | ---------
The geo-create view must handle GET requests correctly. | When a GET request is made to the 'geo-create' URL. | The response should have a status code of 401 (Unauthorized), indicating authentication is required to access the geolocation creation form. | test_geo_create_get_without_authentication

#### Geo Delete View Requirements

Requirement | Condition | Expected Outcome | Test Case
----------- | --------- | ---------------- | ---------
The geo-delete view must handle GET requests correctly. | When a GET request is made to the 'geo-delete' URL with a valid IP address. | The response should have a status code of 401 (Unauthorized), indicating authentication is required to delete geolocation data. | test_geo_delete_get_without_authentication
